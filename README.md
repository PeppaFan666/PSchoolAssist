# PSchoolAssist
A tool I made to help me through school.

Current build: 
 - 0.06:
   - Switched to tab system to allow for more tools in the application.
   - Added About Pages and took 'Peppa' down from the text editor as it was unprofessional to use in school.
   - Added Base Converter (i.e base 10 to binary) as it provided a nice dummy page and established conversion UI that can be reused for other things like chemistry.

Current Features:
  - Base N to Base X converter
  - Dark mode text editor
  - File Saving (only save in browser, but I don't see a reason why it needs hard drive acess yet either.)
  - Copy Paste

Planned Features:
  - Study Cards
  - Presentation Maker
  - Notecards
  - Markdown Support (Italics, Bold, Textsize) - Note, I am not sure if this is doable.
  
Additional Notes:
  - 8/20/22: Despite having another update within a day I do not expect to work to freqently on this. There are 2 major tools I'd like to have on this website within a couple weeks but they are not my current top priority, and once they are done updates will probably slow for a while.

Old Notes:
  - As of 8/19/22 I have many projects, this was a quick throwtogether I made in 2 hours as I wanted to have a better text editor. (It isnt yet but I digress).
   Due to this I will be focusing on other projects for the time being, though I will likley add the presentation maker soon.

Old Builds:
 - 0.05 (took 5 trys run in browser)
