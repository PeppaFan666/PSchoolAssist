# PSchoolAssist
A tool I made to help me through school.

Current build: 
 - 0.05 (took 5 trys run in browser)

Current Features:
  - Dark mode text editor
  - File Saving (only save in browser, but I don't see a reason why it needs hard drive acess yet either.)
  - Copy Paste

Planned Features:
  - Presentation Maker
  - Notecards
  - Markdown Support (Italics, Bold, Textsize) - Note, I am not sure if this is doable.
  
Additional Notes:
  - As of 8/19/22 I have many projects, this was a quick throwtogether I made in 2 hours as I wanted to have a better text editor. (It isnt yet but I digress).
   Due to this I will be focusing on other projects for the time being, though I will likley add the presentation maker soon.
